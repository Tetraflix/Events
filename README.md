# Tetraflix: Events Service

The Event service processes user click activity in the browser. Users are considered to be in an active session from the time that they are logged in, to the time that they log out or are timed out by the system (client). The duration of an active session will vary from user to user, as well as from session to session. When a user’s session ends, the Events service processes click events from that user’s time on the site in order to construct a timeline of that user’s activity during this period.
